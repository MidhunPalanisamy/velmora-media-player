# 🎬 Velmora

Velmora is a robust, production-grade desktop video player built with Electron. It features a smart media library system, real-time folder watching, and advanced playback controls including a VLC-style audio boost.

## ✨ Features

- **📁 Smart Media Library**: Automatically organizes your videos into playlists based on folders.
- **🔄 Real-Time Sync**: Watchers monitor your folders and update the library instantly when files are added, removed, or renamed.
- **🔊 Audio Boost**: VLC-style audio amplification up to 200% with built-in dynamics compression to prevent distortion.
- **📐 Universal Aspect Ratio**: Automatic scaling (`object-fit: contain`) ensures all videos, including vertical ones, display perfectly without cropping.
- **💾 Persistent Storage**: Remembers your library and settings across restarts using JSON-based persistence.
- **🔍 Advanced Search**: Search by video title or playlist name; matching playlists are highlighted and automatically expanded.
- **⌨️ Media Hotkeys**: Standard playback controls (Space for play/pause, Arrows for seeking, etc.).
- **⚙️ Professional UI**: A clean, modern dark theme with red accents and intuitive icon-based controls.
